Overview
The map is not a single picture.
It is made up of two layers: map tiles, and markers.
The javascript program (API) used to create the map is called Leaflet
leafletjs.com
The use of tiles keeps load speeds down, while allowing it to be zoomed to a high level.
See more about tiles here: http://blog.mikecouturier.com/2011/07/create-zoomable-images-using-google.
(Note the author uses a different API, but the tiling concept is the same.)

Map Photo

Editable using GIMP
To change nation colors easily, select by color
Make no two colors exactly the same to make it easier to select by color
Make sure to keep the photo square
